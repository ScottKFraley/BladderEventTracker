"Set up a .venv for the OneNote Py script because reasons." 

I had to set up the 'venv' because the script I had AI write me to get to my OneNote Notebook(s)/Section(s)/Page(s) requires Azure libraries, etc. and I don't want to install them globally.

Actually, deleting the .venv folder today (Mar 1, 2025) since it looks like I'm not going to be allowed to programmatically access said info. without giving MS a big pile of fucking money.
